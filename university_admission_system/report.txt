-------------------In main() function.-----------------------------------------------
1- university_array[3] object invoked the evaluate_student method with constant reference to student3 argument, so no copy constructor invoked and no memory allocated.
-------------------In evalute_student() function.------------------------------------
2- Local student object in evaluate_student method invoked the get_gpa() getter method with no arguments. 
3- Again, local student object in evaluate_student method invoked the get_gre() getter method with no arguments.
4- Again, local student object in evaluate_student method invoked the get_toefl() getter method with no arguments.
5- If if statement satisfied, local student object invoked the get_name() getter method with no arguments.
5- Else, local student object invoked the get_name() getter method with no arguments.
6- Local student object invoked the increment_num_of_app() method with no arguments. The mutable num_of_app incremented in that function.
-------------------In main() function.-----------------------------------------------
7- delete keyword invoked the destructor of the student class with no arguments by student4. Then, this object is deleted from heap.
8- As there is no statement but return, other objects deleted in the exact reverse order as they created because they stored in the stack.
So, destructors of the objects are called in that order Amy -> Ross -> Michael.
9- Then, the university_array is deleted from the stack. Because there is no explicit destructor of University object, default destructor is called respectively.
-------------------return 0; (end of the story)--------------------------------------
